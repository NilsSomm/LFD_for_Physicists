# Acknowledgments

The material in this book has evolved over several years. The genesis was an intensive three-week summer school course taught at the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/) in 2019 by the authors as part of the [TALENT](https://fribtheoryalliance.org/TALENT/) initiative. 
New material was subsequently added by [Christian Forssén](https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/f2bcf/) for course developments at Chalmers and for lecture series at other universities. Significant contributions from Andreas Ekström are particulaly acknowledged. 
In parallel, [Dick Furnstahl](https://physics.osu.edu/people/furnstahl.1) adapted the TALENT material for a graduate course at The Ohio State University, which was then revised by [Daniel Phillips](https://www.ohio.edu/cas/phillid1) for a course at Ohio University.
This book is a merger and update of all these developments.

Both the original notes and subsequent revisions have been informed by interactions with many colleagues, who have taught us different aspects of Bayesian inference. 
This includes many statistician colleagues who have taken the time to carefully and patiently address our misconceptions regarding statistics, probability, or even basic mathematics. Many of the important interactions have occurred at meeting in the [ISNET](https://isnet-series.github.io/meetings/) series.
Among our physics and statistics colleagues we are particularly grateful to:
* Andreas Ekström, Chalmers University of Technology
* Morten Hjorth-Jensen, Oslo University and Michigan State University
* Jordan Melendez, Ohio State University and Root Insurance
* Matt Plumlee, Northwestern University and Amazon
* Matt Pratola, Indiana University
* Ian Vernon, Durham University
* Sarah Wesolowski, York, UK
* Frederi Viens, Michigan State University


Many of the advanced Bayesian methods that might be included in these notes have been used in scientific studies with different collaborators. In particular, several postdocs, PhD students and master students have had leading roles in the development and application of these methods to address various scientific questions. Christian Forssén would like to highlight the contributions (in alphabetical order) of: Boris Carlsson, Tor Djärv, Weiguang Jiang, Eleanor May, Isak Svensson, and Oliver Thim.

The full list of people that have contributed with ideas, discussions, or by generously sharing their knowledge is very long. Rather than inadvertently omitting someone, we simply say thank you to all. More generally, we are truly thankful for being part of an academic environment in which ideas and efforts are shared rather than kept isolated.
The last statement extends to the open-source communities through which great computing tools are made publicly available. In this course we take great advantage of open-source python libraries.

The development of this course would not have been possible without the knowledge gained through the study of several excellent textbooks, most of which are listed as recommended course literature. Here is a short list of those references that we have found particularly useful as physicists learning Bayesian statistics and the fundamentals of machine learning:

{cite}`gelman2013bayesian` Andrew Gelman et al., *"Bayesian Data Analysis, Third Edition"*, Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science (2013). <br/>
{cite}`Gregory2005` Phil Gregory, *"Bayesian Logical Data Analysis for the Physical Sciences"*, Cambridge University Press (2005). <br/>
{cite}`Jaynes2003` E. T. Jaynes, *"Probability Theory: The Logic of Science"*, Cambridge University Press (2003). <br/>
{cite}`Mackay2003` David J.C. MacKay, *"Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms"*, Cambridge University Press (2005). <br/>
{cite}`Sivia2006` D.S. Sivia with J. Skilling, *"Data Analysis : A Bayesian Tutorial"*, Oxford University Press (2006).



Needless to say, although we have benefited tremendously from all this input, any errors that remain in this book are solely our responsibility.

Lastly we thank our spouses for their support and for putting up with us occasionally lapsing into Bayes speak in everyday life.
