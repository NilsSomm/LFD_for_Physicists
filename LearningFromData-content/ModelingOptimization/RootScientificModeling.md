# Overview of scientific modeling material

The material here supplements the Bayesian methods for scientific modeling introduced in {ref}`part:Basics` with a more traditional viewpoint.
* {ref}`sec:OverviewModeling` address scientific models in general and regression analysis in particular. Comparisons are made between parametric and non-parametric models and between linear and non-linear models.
* {ref}`sec:LinearModels` gives a complete treatment of conventional (as opposed to Bayesian) linear regression.
* {ref}`sec:MathematicalOptimization` describes optimization schemes, which are of particular interest for minimizing loss functions of neural networks. In particular, gradient descent is covered in some detail, including stochastic and adaptive algorithms (see also {ref}`sec:GradientDescent`).
