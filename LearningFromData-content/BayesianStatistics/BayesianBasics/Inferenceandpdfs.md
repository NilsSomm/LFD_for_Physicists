#  Inference and PDFs

In this chapter we put on the table the basic ingredients for Bayesian inference. 
The subsections are:
* {ref}`sec:Inference:statements`: Notation for probability statements
* {ref}`sec:Inference:manipulation`
* {ref}`sec:Inference:PDFs`. Extension of the Bayesian rules of probability to continuous probability density functions.
* {ref}`sec:Inference:looking_ahead`: pointers to further insight on Bayes' theorem
* {ref}`exercise:CheckingSumProduct`. Practice applying the sum and product rules (and their consequences: marginalization, Bayes' theorem, conditional independence) using a simple frequentist example. 
* {ref}`exercise:MedicalExample`. Practice on translating English statements into probability notation and then applying the Bayesian rules.
* {ref}`sec:MoreBayesTheorem`. Further details on Bayes' theorem.
* {ref}`sec:BayesianEpistemology`. Philosophical remarks on the interpretation of probabilities.
* {ref}`sec:DataModelsPredictions`. Introduction to statistical models, posterior predictive distributions, and Bayesian parameter estimation.
