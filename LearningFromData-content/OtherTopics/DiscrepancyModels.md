# Bayesian approach to model discrepancy

In {numref}`sec:DataModelsPredictions` we introduced the mismatch term $\delta M$, typically referred to as a model discrepancy, in the statistical model

$$
\data = M(\pars) + \delta \data + \delta M.
$$ (eq:DiscrepancyModels:mismatch)

In this chapter, we describe and illustrate an approach to model discrepancy that uses Gaussian processes (see {numref}`sec:RootGP`) to model $\delta M$.
