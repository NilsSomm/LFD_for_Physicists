# Error propagation

In Bayesian statistics, error propagation is the process of determining how uncertainties in input parameters, which are characterized by probability distributions, influence the uncertainty (again, as a PDF) in the final output of a model. 
In general, Bayesian methods use the full PDFs to propagate uncertainty, in contrast to frequentist approaches.
In this chapter we look at three aspects of error propagation plus solutions to exercises:
* {ref}`sec:ErrorPropagationI`
* {ref}`sec:BayesianAdvantages:ChangingVariables`
* {ref}`sec:ErrorPropagationIII`
* {ref}`sec:ErrorPropagationSolutions`
