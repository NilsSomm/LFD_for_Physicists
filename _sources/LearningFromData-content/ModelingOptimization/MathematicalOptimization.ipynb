    "*Gradient descent* is probably the most popular class of algorithms to perform optimization. It is certainly the most common way to optimize neural networks. Although there are different flavours of gradient descent, as will be discussed, the general feature is an iterative search for a (locally) optimal solution using the gradient of the cost function. Basically, the parameters are tuned in the opposite direction of the gradient of the objective function, thus aiming to follow the direction of the slope downhill until we reach a valley. The evaluation of this gradient at every iteration is often the major computational bottleneck. \n",

    "1. It requires the computation of partial derivatives of the cost function. This might be straight-forward for the linear regression method, see Eq. {eq}`eq:LinearRegression:gradient`, but can be very difficult for other models. Numerical differentiation can be computationally costly. Instead, *automatic differentiation* has become an important tool and there are software libraries for different programming languages. See, e.g., [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for Python, which is well worth exploring. \n",
    "2. Most cost functions&mdash;in particular in many dimensions&mdash;correspond to very *complicated surfaces with several local minima*. In those cases, gradient descent will not likely not find the global minimum.\n",
    "3. Choosing a proper learning rate can be difficult. A learning rate that is too small leads to painfully slow convergence, while a learning rate that is too large can hinder convergence and cause the parameter updates to fluctuate around the minimum.\n",
    "4. Standard gradient-descent has particular difficulties to navigate ravines and saddle points for which the gradient is large in some directions and small in others.\n",

    "For the remainder of this chapter we will consider gradient descent methods for the minimization of data-dependent cost functions, for example representing a sum of squared residuals between model predictions and observed data such as Eq. {eq}`eq:LinearRegression:cost-function`. Note that we are interested in general models, not just restricted to linear ones, for which the computational cost for evaluating the cost function and its gradient could be significant (and scale with the number of data that enter the cost function). For situations where data is abundant there are variations of gradient descent that uses only fractions of the data set for computation of the gradient. \n",

However, employing a learning rate that slowly decreases with iterations, SGD can be much more efficient than BGD. A typical Python implementation would look something like the following:\n",

These are in general connected with the difficulty of navigating complicated cost function surfaces using only pointwise information on the gradient. The use of the history of past updates can help to adapt the learning schedule and has been shown to significantly increase the efficiency of gradient descent. Somewhat simplified, the adaptive versions improves the parameter update by adding a fraction of the past update vector to the current one.\n",
